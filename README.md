 ## About the Project
 - Machine Learning models require massive quantities of human tagged data points, which often require vast amounts of time and human resources to create
 - **Tagr** helps source this data through an easy-to-use UI and quick response times, allowing users to tag data points in seconds
- Built using Next.js , Prisma , and TailwindCSS
